# Tic Tac Toe Project

### Description
Who doesn't love tic taco toe? It's everyone's favorite game to play at those restaurants with paper table clothes. I mean, really,  that's the only time we ever play this game, right? Well, if you are ever bored out of your mind, now you are able to play this game anywhere with wifi! Enjoy!

### How it Works
- 2 teams: Heart versus Star
- Try to get three in a row before the other team
- Once a space is occupied, another player cannot take that space
- Heart will go first the first round, rotating who goes first each round

### Technologies Implemented:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### Future Updates
- Save win boards from previous wins on the column
- Add reset win count button
- Invite a friend to play on there computer
- Add different skins for board and pieces.
